    <h1>
        MADAM Readme</h1>
    <p>This document contains information about how to get started with MADAM (Mixed Authentication and 
        Disposition ASP.NET Module) and its demo web application.</p>
    <h2>MADAM Visual Studio Project</h2>
    <p>
        The MADAM
        library is in the <tt>Madam</tt> folder and is provided as a Visual Studio .NET 2003
        C# Code Library project. How to open this project file depends on the version of
        Microsoft Visual Studio you are using:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Visual Studio .NET 2003</dt><dd>Just open the solution file <tt>Madam.sln</tt>.</dd>
        <dt>Visual Studio 2005</dt>
        <dd>
            Open the <tt>Madam.sln</tt> solution file in Visual Studio 2005. This will start
            the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60z6y467(VS.80).aspx">Visual Studio
                Conversion Wizard</a> and which should convert the project without reporting
            any issues. See also <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms185327(VS.80).aspx">How to 
            Upgrade Projects Created in Visual Studio .NET 2002 or 2003</a>.</dd></dl>
    <h2>MADAM Demo Web</h2>
    <p>
        The <tt>Web</tt> folder contains a web application that demonstrates MADAM. There's
        no project file provided for this web application so if you're using Visual Studio
        .NET 2003 and want to work on this project from within Microsoft Visual Studio .NET,
        you'll need to create one. 
        Alternatively you can configure IIS to create an IIS
        Application pointing to that folder and visit the demo directly through a browser.</p>
    <p>
        If you are using Visual Studio 2005 you can just open a File-System based Website
        (from the main menu, click <strong>File</strong> then <strong>Open Web Site</strong>) and browse to
        the <tt>Web</tt> folder.</p>
    <p>
        The web application's <tt>Web.config</tt> file contains different user security authority
        implementation examples. The <tt>FormsUserSecurityAuthority</tt> is enabled by default, but
        there are examples for the <tt>DatabaseUserSecurityAuthority</tt> and a custom 
        <tt>MembershipUserSecurityAuthority</tt> (ASP.NET 2.0 only)
        provided in the comments. To enable an alternate user security authority, comment
        out the current one and uncomment the one to use, making any configuration changes
        for the user security authority implementation as needed.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> To successfully test the Basic authentication with the
        demo web site under IIS, you must ensure that the demo application is configured
        for <em>Anonymous access only</em>. Any other authentication methods from IIS will
        conflict with the operation of Basic authentication from MADAM.</p>
