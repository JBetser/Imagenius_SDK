        // Since MembershipUserSecurityAuthority under App_Code gets compiled
        // into a dynamically generated assembly, its name cannot be known 
        // at design-time and therefore specified in web.config. The 
        // following type resolution hook takes care of this problem. In
        // web.config, you can simply specify
        // "MembershipUserSecurityAuthority" for the provider attribute of
        // the <userSecurityAuthority> configuration element:
        //
        //  <userSecurityAuthority 
        //      realm="MADAM" 
        //      provider="MembershipUserSecurityAuthority" 
        //      exposeClearTextPasswords="true" />
        //
        // The reason why type resolution fails is that MADAM was compiled
        // against runtime version 1.1 where it uses Type.GetType on the
        // provider attribute. In the absence of an assembly name, 
        // Type.GetType will search the calling assembly (MADAM) and 
        // mscorlib only, which obviously fails for dynamic code and the 
        // new compilation model in ASP.NET 2.0. In ASP.NET 2.0, one is asked 
        // to use BuildManager.GetType instead for resolving types. The 
        // following hook therefore accomodates this change without needing
        // to re-compile MADAM for runtime version 2.0.
        //
